9," While Asia is commonly referred to as the Gateway to Europe, it is no less true that Europe is the Gateway to Asia, and the broad influence of the one cannot fail to have its impact upon the other",Anti-Green,-0.2484

18," Long exploited by the so-called colonial powers, with little opportunity to achieve any degree of social justice, individual dignity, or a higher standard of life such as guided our own noble administration in the Philippines, the peoples of Asia found their opportunity in the war just past to throw off the shackles of colonialism and now see the dawn of new opportunity, a heretofore unfelt dignity, and the self-respect of political freedom",Anti-Conservative,-0.0258
19,"Mustering half of the earth’s population, and 60 percent of its natural resources these peoples are rapidly consolidating a new force, both moral and material, with which to raise the living standard and erect adaptations of the design of modern progress to their own distinct cultural environments",Non-Aligned,0.4215
20," Whether one adheres to the concept of colonization or not, this is the direction of Asian progress and it may not be stopped",Non-Aligned,0.1531

25, World ideologies play little part in Asian thinking and are little understood,LibDem,0.34

27," These political-social conditions have but an indirect bearing upon our own national security, but do form a backdrop to contemporary planning which must be thoughtfully considered if we are to avoid the pitfalls of unrealism",Anti-LibDem,-0.296
28,Of more direct and immediately bearing upon our national security are the changes wrought in the strategic potential of the Pacific Ocean in the course of the past war,Anti-Green,-0.5994
29," Prior thereto the western strategic frontier of the United States lay on the littoral line of the Americas, with an exposed island salient extending out through Hawaii, Midway, and Guam to the Philippines",Non-Aligned,0.4215

37,*Any predatory attack from Asia must be an amphibious effort,Non-Aligned,-0.4767
38,* No amphibious force can be successful without control of the sea lanes and the air over those lanes in its avenue of advance,Non-Aligned,0.5719
39," With naval and air supremacy and modest ground elements to defend bases, any major attack from continental Asia toward us or our friends in the Pacific would be doomed to failure",Non-Aligned,-0.3818
40,"Under such conditions, the Pacific no longer represents menacing avenues of approach for a prospective invader",Non-Aligned,0.296

42, Our line of defense is a natural one and can be maintained with a minimum of military effort and expense,Non-Aligned,0.0
43," It envisions no attack against anyone, nor does it provide the bastions essential for offensive operations, but properly maintained, would be an invincible defense against aggression",Non-Aligned,-0.6597
44, The holding of this littoral defense line in the western Pacific is entirely dependent upon holding all segments thereof; for any major breach of that line by an unfriendly power would render vulnerable to determined attack every other major segment,Non-Aligned,-0.4767
45,This is a military estimate as to which I have yet to find a military leader who will take exception,Non-Aligned,0.0

51," At the turn of the century, under the regime of Chang Tso Lin, efforts toward greater homogeneity produced the start of a nationalist urge",Labour,0.3612
52," This was further and more successfully developed under the leadership of Chiang Kai-Shek, but has been brought to its greatest fruition under the present regime to the point that it has now taken on the character of a united nationalism of increasingly dominant, aggressive tendencies",LibDem,0.886

61,"The Japanese people, since the war, have undergone the greatest reformation recorded in modern history",Conservative,0.0772
62," With a commendable will, eagerness to learn, and marked capacity to understand, they have, from the ashes left in war’s wake, erected in Japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity; and in the ensuing process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance of political morality, freedom of economic enterprise, and social justice",LibDem,0.8519

74," While I was not consulted prior to the President’s decision to intervene in support of the Republic of Korea, that decision from a military standpoint, proved a sound one, as we hurled back the invader and decimated his forces",UKIP,0.4019

77,Such decisions have not been forthcoming,Conservative,0.0
78,"While no man in his right mind would advocate sending our ground forces into continental China, and such was never given a thought, the new situation did urgently demand a drastic revision of strategic planning if our political aim was to defeat this new enemy as we had defeated the old",Anti-LibDem,-0.6908
79,"Apart from the military need, as I saw It, to neutralize the sanctuary protection given the enemy north of the Yalu, I felt that military necessity in the conduct of the war made necessary: first the intensification of our economic blockade against China; two the imposition of a naval blockade against the China coast; three removal of restrictions on air reconnaissance of China’s coastal areas and of Manchuria; four removal of restrictions on the forces of the Republic of China on Formosa, with logistical support to contribute to their effective operations against the common enemy",Anti-LibDem,-0.5859
80,"For entertaining these views, all professionally designed to support our forces committed to Korea and bring hostilities to an end with the least possible delay and at a saving of countless American and allied lives, I have been severely criticized in lay circles, principally abroad, despite my understanding that from a military standpoint the above views have been fully shared in the past by practically every military leader concerned with the Korean campaign, including our own Joint Chiefs of Staff",Conservative,0.802
81,I called for reinforcements but was informed that reinforcements were not available,LibDem,0.0
82," I made clear that if not permitted to destroy the enemy built-up bases north of the Yalu, if not permitted to utilize the friendly Chinese Force of some 600,000 men on Formosa, if not permitted to blockade the China coast to prevent the Chinese Reds from getting succor from without, and if there were to be no hope of major reinforcements, the position of the command from the military standpoint forbade victory",Anti-UKIP,-0.4949
83,"We could hold in Korea by constant maneuver and in an approximate area where our supply line advantages were in balance with the supply line disadvantages of the enemy, but we could hope at best for only an indecisive campaign with its terrible and constant attrition upon our forces if the enemy utilized its full military potential",UKIP,0.7964

88," I know war as few other men now living know it, and nothing to me is more revolting",Anti-UKIP,-0.5994

107,"Some may say: to avoid spread of the conflict into an all-out war with China; others, to avoid Soviet intervention",Anti-LibDem,-0.8625

0,Strange and impressive associations rise in the mind of a man from the New World who speaks before this august body in this ancient institution of learning,Non-Aligned,0.4404
1," Before his eyes pass the shadows of mighty kings and war-like nobles, of great masters of law and theology; through the shining dust of the dead centuries he sees crowded figures that tell of the power and learning and splendor of times gone by; and he sees also the innumerable host of humble students to whom clerkship meant emancipation, to whom it was well-nigh the only outlet from the dark thraldom of the Middle Ages",Non-Aligned,0.5859
2,This was the most famous university of mediaeval Europe at a time when no one dreamed that there was a New World to discover,Non-Aligned,0.25
3," Its services to the cause of human knowledge already stretched far back into the remote past at a time when my forefathers, three centuries ago, were among the sparse bands of traders, ploughmen, wood-choppers, and fisherfolk who, in hard struggle with the iron unfriendliness of the Indian-haunted land, were laying the foundations of what has now become the giant republic of the West",Non-Aligned,0.25
4," To conquer a continent, to tame the shaggy roughness of wild nature, means grim warfare; and the generations engaged in it cannot keep, still less add to, the stores of garnered wisdom which where once theirs, and which are still in the hands of their brethren who dwell in the old land",Green,0.5267
5, To conquer the wilderness means to wrest victory from the same hostile forces with which mankind struggled on the immemorial infancy of our race,UKIP,0.0
6, The primaeval conditions must be met by the primaeval qualities which are incompatible with the retention of much that has been painfully acquired by humanity as through the ages it has striven upward toward civilization,LibDem,0.128
7, In conditions so primitive there can be but a primitive culture,SNP,0.0
8," At first only the rudest school can be established, for no others would meet the needs of the hard-driven, sinewy folk who thrust forward the frontier in the teeth of savage men and savage nature; and many years elapse before any of these schools can develop into seats of higher learning and broader culture",Non-Aligned,-0.5423
9,"The pioneer days pass; the stump-dotted clearings expand into vast stretches of fertile farm land; the stockaded clusters of log cabins change into towns; the hunters of game, the fellers of trees, the rude frontier traders and tillers of the soil, the men who wander all their lives long through the wilderness as the heralds and harbingers of an oncoming civilization, themselves vanish before the civilization for which they have prepared the way",Green,0.2263
10," The children of their successors and supplanters, and then their children and their children and children’s children, change and develop with extraordinary rapidity",Labour,0.2263
11," The conditions accentuate vices and virtues, energy and ruthlessness, all the good qualities and all the defects of an intense individualism, self-reliant, self-centered, far more conscious of its rights than of its duties, and blind to its own shortcomings",Non-Aligned,-0.296
12, To the hard materialism of the frontier days succeeds the hard materialism of an industrialism even more intense and absorbing than that of the older nations; although these themselves have likewise already entered on the age of a complex and predominantly industrial civilization,Anti-Conservative,-0.2023
13,"As the country grows, its people, who have won success in so many lines, turn back to try to recover the possessions of the mind and the spirit, which perforce their fathers threw aside in order better to wage the first rough battles for the continent their children inherit",UKIP,0.8074
14," The leaders of thought and of action grope their way forward to a new life, realizing, sometimes dimly, sometimes clear-sightedly, that the life of material gain, whether for a nation or an individual, is of value only as a foundation, only as there is added to it the uplift that comes from devotion to loftier ideals",Non-Aligned,0.7783
15," The new life thus sought can in part be developed afresh from what is roundabout in the New World; but it can developed in full only by freely drawing upon the treasure-houses of the Old World, upon the treasures stored in the ancient abodes of wisdom and learning, such as this is where I speak to-day",Non-Aligned,0.5267
16," It is a mistake for any nation to merely copy another; but it is even a greater mistake, it is a proof of weakness in any nation, not to be anxious to learn from one another and willing and able to adapt that learning to the new national conditions and make it fruitful and productive therein",Non-Aligned,-0.1027
17," It is for us of the New World to sit at the feet of Gamaliel of the Old; then, if we have the right stuff in us, we can show that Paul in his turn can become a teacher as well as a scholar",Green,0.2732
18,"To-day I shall speak to you on the subject of individual citizenship, the one subject of vital importance to you, my hearers, and to me and my countrymen, because you and we a great citizens of great democratic republics",LibDem,0.886
19," A democratic republic such as ours – an effort to realize its full sense government by, of, and for the people – represents the most gigantic of all possible social experiments, the one fraught with great responsibilities alike for good and evil",Non-Aligned,0.3818
20," The success or republics like yours and like ours means the glory, and our failure of despair, of mankind; and for you and for us the question of the quality of the individual citizen is supreme",Non-Aligned,0.7506
21," Under other forms of government, under the rule of one man or very few men, the quality of the leaders is all-important",Labour,0.0
22," If, under such governments, the quality of the rulers is high enough, then the nations for generations lead a brilliant career, and add substantially to the sum of world achievement, no matter how low the quality of average citizen; because the average citizen is an almost negligible quantity in working out the final results of that type of national greatness",Labour,0.7845
23,But with you and us the case is different,Non-Aligned,0.0
24," With you here, and with us in my own home, in the long run, success or failure will be conditioned upon the way in which the average man, the average women, does his or her duty, first in the ordinary, every-day affairs of life, and next in those great occasional cries which call for heroic virtues",Labour,0.9081
25, The average citizen must be a good citizen if our republics are to succeed,Labour,0.7269
26, The stream will not permanently rise higher than the main source; and the main source of national power and national greatness is found in the average citizenship of the nation,Conservative,0.6249
27, Therefore it behooves us to do our best to see that the standard of the average citizen is kept high; and the average cannot be kept high unless the standard of the leaders is very much higher,UKIP,0.6369
28,"It is well if a large proportion of the leaders in any republic, in any democracy, are, as a matter of course, drawn from the classes represented in this audience to-day; but only provided that those classes possess the gifts of sympathy with plain people and of devotion to great ideals",UKIP,0.9118
29, You and those like you have received special advantages; you have all of you had the opportunity for mental training; many of you have had leisure; most of you have had a chance for enjoyment of life far greater than comes to the majority of your fellows,DUP,0.872
30," To you and your kind much has been given, and from you much should be expected",LibDem,0.7003
31," Yet there are certain failings against which it is especially incumbent that both men of trained and cultivated intellect, and men of inherited wealth and position should especially guard themselves, because to these failings they are especially liable; and if yielded to, their – your – chances of useful service are at an end",LibDem,0.0772
32,"Let the man of learning, the man of lettered leisure, beware of that queer and cheap temptation to pose to himself and to others as a cynic, as the man who has outgrown emotions and beliefs, the man to whom good and evil are as one",Anti-LibDem,-0.3612
33, The poorest way to face life is to face it with a sneer,Anti-Conservative,-0.5423
34, There are many men who feel a kind of twister pride in cynicism; there are many who confine themselves to criticism of the way others do what they themselves dare not even attempt,LibDem,0.3182
35," There is no more unhealthy being, no man less worthy of respect, than he who either really holds, or feigns to hold, an attitude of sneering disbelief toward all that is great and lofty, whether in achievement or in that noble effort which, even if it fails, comes to second achievement",Conservative,0.5302
36," A cynical habit of thought and speech, a readiness to criticise work which the critic himself never tries to perform, an intellectual aloofness which will not accept contact with life’s realities – all these are marks, not as the possessor would fain to think, of superiority but of weakness",Anti-Conservative,-0.0772
37," They mark the men unfit to bear their part painfully in the stern strife of living, who seek, in the affection of contempt for the achievements of others, to hide from others and from themselves in their own weakness",Anti-Labour,-0.8934
38," The rÃ´le is easy; there is none easier, save only the rÃ´le of the man who sneers alike at both criticism and performance",Anti-Conservative,-0.7236
39,"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better",LibDem,0.6249
40," The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face in marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat",LibDem,0.9369
41, Shame on the man of cultivated taste who permits refinement to develop into fastidiousness that unfits him for doing the rough work of a workaday world,Anti-UKIP,-0.4767
42, Among the free peoples who govern themselves there is but a small field of usefulness open for the men of cloistered life who shrink from contact with their fellows,SNP,0.5106
43," Still less room is there for those who deride of slight what is done by those who actually bear the brunt of the day; nor yet for those others who always profess that they would like to take action, if only the conditions of life were not exactly what they actually are",LibDem,0.3612
44," The man who does nothing cuts the same sordid figure in the pages of history, whether he be a cynic, or fop, or voluptuary",Anti-LibDem,-0.5423
45," There is little use for the being whose tepid soul knows nothing of great and generous emotion, of the high pride, the stern belief, the lofty enthusiasm, of the men who quell the storm and ride the thunder",Non-Aligned,0.8555
46," Well for these men if they succeed; well also, though not so well, if they fail, given only that they have nobly ventured, and have put forth all their heart and strength",SNP,0.802
47," It is war-worn Hotspur, spent with hard fighting, he of the many errors and valiant end, over whose memory we love to linger, not over the memory of the young lord who “but for the vile guns would have been a valiant soldier",Anti-LibDem,-0.7906
48,"”France has taught many lessons to other nations: surely one of the most important lesson is the lesson her whole history teaches, that a high artistic and literary development is compatible with notable leadership im arms and statecraft",Conservative,0.5719
49," The brilliant gallantry of the French soldier has for many centuries been proverbial; and during these same centuries at every court in Europe the “freemasons of fashion: have treated the French tongue as their common speech; while every artist and man of letters, and every man of science able to appreciate that marvelous instrument of precision, French prose, had turned toward France for aid and inspiration",Green,0.8934
50, How long the leadership in arms and letters has lasted is curiously illustrated by the fact that the earliest masterpiece in a modern tongue is the splendid French epic which tells of Roland’s doom and the vengeance of Charlemange when the lords of the Frankish hosts where stricken at Roncesvalles,UKIP,0.3612
51,"Let those who have, keep, let those who have not, strive to attain, a high standard of cultivation and scholarship",Non-Aligned,0.0
52, Yet let us remember that these stand second to certain other things,Non-Aligned,0.2732
53," There is need of a sound body, and even more of a sound mind",Non-Aligned,0.0
54," But above mind and above body stands character – the sum of those qualities which we mean when we speak of a man’s force and courage, of his good faith and sense of honor",Non-Aligned,0.836
55," I believe in exercise for the body, always provided that we keep in mind that physical development is a means and not an end",Non-Aligned,0.0
56," I believe, of course, in giving to all the people a good education",Non-Aligned,0.4404
57, But the education must contain much besides book-learning in order to be really good,Non-Aligned,0.4404
58," We must ever remember that no keenness and subtleness of intellect, no polish, no cleverness, in any way make up for the lack of the great solid qualities",LibDem,0.8979
59," Self restraint, self mastery, common sense, the power of accepting individual responsibility and yet of acting in conjunction with others, courage and resolution – these are the qualities which mark a masterful people",Conservative,0.3818
60," Without them no people can control itself, or save itself from being controlled from the outside",Anti-Labour,-0.3875
61," I speak to brilliant assemblage; I speak in a great university which represents the flower of the highest intellectual development; I pay all homage to intellect and to elaborate and specialized training of the intellect; and yet I know I shall have the assent of all of you present when I add that more important still are the commonplace, every-day qualities and virtues",Non-Aligned,0.9451
62,"Such ordinary, every-day qualities include the will and the power to work, to fight at need, and to have plenty of healthy children",Anti-Labour,-0.3818
63, The need that the average man shall work is so obvious as hardly to warrant insistence,LibDem,0.0
64, There are a few people in every country so born that they can lead lives of leisure,LibDem,0.0
65," These fill a useful function if they make it evident that leisure does not mean idleness; for some of the most valuable work needed by civilization is essentially non-remunerative in its character, and of course the people who do this work should in large part be drawn from those to whom remuneration is an object of indifference",LibDem,0.0
66, But the average man must earn his own livelihood,Conservative,0.2023
67," He should be trained to do so, and he should be trained to feel that he occupies a contemptible position if he does not do so; that he is not an object of envy if he is idle, at whichever end of the social scale he stands, but an object of contempt, an object of derision",Anti-Labour,-0.8225
68,"In the next place, the good man should be both a strong and a brave man; that is, he should be able to fight, he should be able to serve his country as a soldier, if the need arises",Conservative,0.7906
69, There are well-meaning philosophers who declaim against the unrighteousness of war,Non-Aligned,-0.5994
70, They are right only if they lay all their emphasis upon the unrighteousness,Non-Aligned,0.0
71," War is a dreadful thing, and unjust war is a crime against humanity",Anti-Green,-0.9559
72," But it is such a crime because it is unjust, not because it is a war",Non-Aligned,-0.8934
73," The choice must ever be in favor of righteousness, and this is whether the alternative be peace or whether the alternative be war",Non-Aligned,-0.296
74," The question must not be merely, Is there to be peace or war? The question must be, Is it right to prevail? Are the great laws of righteousness once more to be fulfilled? And the answer from a strong and virile people must be “Yes,” whatever the cost",LibDem,0.5423
75," Every honorable effort should always be made to avoid war, just as every honorable effort should always be made by the individual in private life to keep out of a brawl, to keep out of trouble; but no self-respecting individual, no self-respecting nation, can or ought to submit to wrong",Non-Aligned,-0.4215
76,"Finally, even more important than ability to work, even more important than ability to fight at need, is it to remember that chief of blessings for any nations is that it shall leave its seed to inherit the land",LibDem,0.0516
77, It was the crown of blessings in Biblical times and it is the crown of blessings now,Non-Aligned,0.6808
78," The greatest of all curses in is the curse of sterility, and the severest of all condemnations should be that visited upon willful sterility",Non-Aligned,0.0258
79," The first essential in any civilization is that the man and women shall be father and mother of healthy children, so that the race shall increase and not decrease",Non-Aligned,0.0
80," If that is not so, if through no fault of the society there is failure to increase, it is a great misfortune",Labour,0.34
81," If the failure is due to the deliberate and wilful fault, then it is not merely a misfortune, it is one of those crimes of ease and self-indulgence, of shrinking from pain and effort and risk, which in the long run Nature punishes more heavily than any other",Non-Aligned,-0.9325
82," If we of the great republics, if we, the free people who claim to have emancipated ourselves form the thraldom of wrong and error, bring down on our heads the curse that comes upon the willfully barren, then it will be an idle waste of breath to prattle of our achievements, to boast of all that we have done",Green,0.3818
83," No refinement of life, no delicacy of taste, no material progress, no sordid heaping up riches, no sensuous development of art and literature, can in any way compensate for the loss of the great fundamental virtues; and of these great fundamental virtues the greatest is the race’s power to perpetuate the race",Non-Aligned,0.9552
84,Character must show itself in the man’s performance both of the duty he owes himself and of the duty he owes the state,UKIP,0.0
85," The man’s foremast duty is owed to himself and his family; and he can do this duty only by earning money, by providing what is essential to material well-being; it is only after this has been done that he can hope to build a higher superstructure on the solid material foundation; it is only after this has been done that he can help in his movements for the general well-being",SNP,0.875
86," He must pull his own weight first, and only after this can his surplus strength be of use to the general public",Non-Aligned,0.4939
87," It is not good to excite that bitter laughter which expresses contempt; and contempt is what we feel for the being whose enthusiasm to benefit mankind is such that he is a burden to those nearest him; who wishes to do great things for humanity in the abstract, but who cannot keep his wife in comfort or educate his children",Non-Aligned,0.7906
88,"Nevertheless, while laying all stress on this point, while not merely acknowledging but insisting upon the fact that there must be a basis of material well-being for the individual as for the nation, let us with equal emphasis insist that this material well-being represents nothing but the foundation, and that the foundation, though indispensable, is worthless unless upon it is raised the superstructure of a higher life",Non-Aligned,-0.6908
89," That is why I decline to recognize the mere multimillionaire, the man of mere wealth, as an asset of value to any country; and especially as not an asset to my own country",Labour,0.802
90," If he has earned or uses his wealth in a way that makes him a real benefit, of real use – and such is often the case – why, then he does become an asset of real worth",Green,0.9001
91," But it is the way in which it has been earned or used, and not the mere fact of wealth, that entitles him to the credit",Labour,0.802
92," There is need in business, as in most other forms of human activity, of the great guiding intelligences",Non-Aligned,0.6249
93, Their places cannot be supplied by any number of lesser intelligences,Non-Aligned,0.0772
94," It is a good thing that they should have ample recognition, ample reward",Labour,0.765
95," But we must not transfer our admiration to the reward instead of to the deed rewarded; and if what should be the reward exists without the service having been rendered, then admiration will only come from those who are mean of soul",Non-Aligned,0.9022
96," The truth is that, after a certain measure of tangible material success or reward has been achieved, the question of increasing it becomes of constantly less importance compared to the other things that can be done in life",SNP,0.9217
97, It is a bad thing for a nation to raise and to admire a false standard of success; and their can be no falser standard than that set by the deification of material well-being in and for itself,LibDem,0.0516
98," But the man who, having far surpassed the limits of providing for the wants; both of the body and mind, of himself and of those depending upon him, then piles up a great fortune, for the acquisition or retention of which he returns no corresponding benefit to the nation as a whole, should himself be made to feel that, so far from being desirable, he is an unworthy, citizen of the community: that he is to be neither admired nor envied; that his right-thinking fellow countrymen put him low in the scale of citizenship, and leave him to be consoled by the admiration of those whose level of purpose is even lower than his own",Non-Aligned,0.6249
99,My position as regards the moneyed interests can be put in a few words,Non-Aligned,0.4588
100," In every civilized society property rights must be carefully safeguarded; ordinarily, and in the great majority of cases, human rights and property rights are fundamentally and in the long run identical; but when it clearly appears that there is a real conflict between them, human rights must have the upper hand, for property belongs to man and not man to property",LibDem,0.8957
101,"In fact, it is essential to good citizenship clearly to understand that there are certain qualities which we in a democracy are prone to admire in and of themselves, which ought by rights to be judged admirable or the reverse solely from the standpoint of the use made of them",Green,0.6124
102, Foremost among these I should include two very distinct gifts – the gift of money-making and the gift of oratory,Non-Aligned,0.8271
103," Money-making, the money touch I have spoken of above",UKIP,0.0
104, It is a quality which in a moderate degree is essential,LibDem,0.0
105," It may be useful when developed to a very great degree, but only if accompanied and controlled by other qualities; and without such control the possessor tends to develop into one of the least attractive types produced by a modern industrial democracy",Conservative,0.457
106, So it is with the orator,Non-Aligned,0.0
107, It is highly desirable that a leader of opinion in democracy should be able to state his views clearly and convincingly,UKIP,0.0
108," But all that the oratory can do of value to the community is enable the man thus to explain himself; if it enables the orator to put false values on things, it merely makes him power for mischief",Anti-Green,-0.3612
109," Some excellent public servants have not that gift at all, and must merely rely on their deeds to speak for them; and unless oratory does represent genuine conviction based on good common sense and able to be translated into efficient performance, then the better the oratory the greater the damage to the public it deceives",Green,0.9217
110," Indeed, it is a sign of marked political weakness in any commonwealth if the people tend to be carried away by mere oratory, if they tend to value words in and for themselves, as divorced from the deeds for which they are supposed to stand",Anti-UKIP,-0.4404
111," The phrase-maker, the phrase-monger, the ready talker, however great his power, whose speech does not make for courage, sobriety, and right understanding, is simply a noxious element in the body politic, and it speaks ill for the public if he has influence over them",Non-Aligned,0.5719
112, To admire the gift of oratory without regard to the moral quality behind the gift is to do wrong to the republic,Non-Aligned,0.4019
113,"Of course all that I say of the orator applies with even greater force to the orator’s latter-day and more influential brother, the journalist",Labour,0.3612
114," The power of the journalist is great, but he is entitled neither to respect nor admiration because of that power unless it is used aright",LibDem,0.3707
115," He cna do, and often does, great good",Labour,0.7906
116," He can do, and he often does, infinite mischief",Non-Aligned,-0.3612
117," All journalists, all writers, for the very reason that they appreciate the vast possibilities of their profession, should bear testimony against those who deeply discredit it",SNP,0.0
118," Offenses against taste and morals, which are bad enough in a private citizen, are infinitely worse if made into instruments for debauching the community through a newspaper",Non-Aligned,-0.5423
119," Mendacity, slander, sensationalism, inanity, vapid triviality, all are potent factors for the debauchery of the public mind and conscience",Non-Aligned,-0.0258
120," The excuse advanced for vicious writing, that the public demands it and that demand must be supplied, can no more be admitted than if it were advanced by purveyors of food who sell poisonous adulterations",Non-Aligned,-0.5719
121,"In short, the good citizen in a republic must realize that the ought to possess two sets of qualities, and that neither avails without the other",Non-Aligned,0.4404
122, He must have those qualities which make for efficiency; and that he also must have those qualities which direct the efficiency into channels for the public good,LibDem,0.4404
123, He is useless if he is inefficient,Anti-SNP,-0.4215
124, There is nothing to be done with that type of citizen of whom all that can be said is that he is harmless,LibDem,0.25
125, Virtue which is dependant upon a sluggish circulation is not impressive,Non-Aligned,0.0516
126, There is little place in active life for the timid good man,Non-Aligned,0.2263
127, The man who is saved by weakness from robust wickedness is likewise rendered immune from robuster virtues,Non-Aligned,0.1779
128, The good citizen in a republic must first of all be able to hold his own,LibDem,0.4404
129, He is no good citizen unless he has the ability which will make him work hard and which at need will make him fight hard,LibDem,0.2263
130, The good citizen is not a good citizen unless he is an efficient citizen,LibDem,0.7003
131,"But if a man’s efficiency is not guided and regulated by a moral sense, then the more efficient he is the worse he is, the more dangerous to the body politic",Non-Aligned,-0.5267
132," Courage, intellect, all the masterful qualities, serve but to make a man more evil if they are merely used for that man’s own advancement, with brutal indifference to the rights of others",Anti-UKIP,-0.7579
133, It speaks ill for the community if the community worships these qualities and treats their possessors as heroes regardless of whether the qualities are used rightly or wrongly,LibDem,0.6908
134, It makes no difference as to the precise way in which this sinister efficiency is shown,LibDem,0.0
135," It makes no difference whether such a man’s force and ability betray themselves in a career of money-maker or politician, soldier or orator, journalist or popular leader",Anti-UKIP,-0.34
136," If the man works for evil, then the more successful he is the more he should be despised and condemned by all upright and far-seeing men",Non-Aligned,-0.5106
137," To judge a man merely by success is an abhorrent wrong; and if the people at large habitually so judge men, if they grow to condone wickedness because the wicked man triumphs, they show their inability to understand that in the last analysis free institutions rest upon the character of citizenship, and that by such admiration of evil they prove themselves unfit for liberty",Anti-UKIP,-0.2023
138,"The homely virtues of the household, the ordinary workaday virtues which make the woman a good housewife and housemother, which make the man a hard worker, a good husband and father, a good soldier at need, stand at the bottom of character",UKIP,0.8074
139, But of course many other must be added thereto if a state is to be not only free but great,LibDem,0.8126
140, Good citizenship is not good citizenship if only exhibited in the home,LibDem,0.7003
141," There remains the duties of the individual in relation to the State, and these duties are none too easy under the conditions which exist where the effort is made to carry on the free government in a complex industrial civilization",Conservative,0.5106
142," Perhaps the most important thing the ordinary citizen, and, above all, the leader of ordinary citizens, has to remember in political life is that he must not be a sheer doctrinaire",SNP,0.34
143," The closest philosopher, the refined and cultured individual who from his library tells how men ought to be governed under ideal conditions, is of no use in actual governmental work; and the one-sided fanatic, and still more the mob-leader, and the insincere man who to achieve power promises what by no possibility can be performed, are not merely useless but noxious",Labour,0.1531
144,"The citizen must have high ideals, and yet he must be able to achieve them in practical fashion",LibDem,0.5267
145, No permanent good comes from aspirations so lofty that they have grown fantastic and have become impossible and indeed undesirable to realize,Non-Aligned,0.4404
146," The impractical visionary is far less often the guide and precursor than he is the embittered foe of the real reformer, of the man who, with stumblings and shortcoming, yet does in some shape, in practical fashion, give effect to the hopes and desires of those who strive for better things",LibDem,0.4404
147," Woe to the empty phrase-maker, to the empty idealist, who, instead of making ready the ground for the man of action, turns against him when he appears and hampers him when he does work! Moreover, the preacher of ideals must remember how sorry and contemptible is the figure which he will cut, how great the damage that he will do, if he does not himself, in his own life, strive measurably to realize the ideals that he preaches for others",Green,0.7003

0,I spoke the other day of the colossal military disaster which occurred when the French High Command failed to withdraw the northern Armies from Belgium at the moment when they knew that the French front was decisively broken at Sedan and on the Meuse,Anti-UKIP,-0.765
1, This delay entailed the loss of fifteen or sixteen French divisions and threw out of action for the critical period the whole of the British Expeditionary Force,Anti-Conservative,-0.6908
2," Our Army and 120,000 French troops were indeed rescued by the British Navy from Dunkirk but only with the loss of their cannon, vehicles and modern equipment",Anti-UKIP,-0.3182
3," This loss inevitably took some weeks to repair, and in the first two of those weeks the battle in France has been lost",Anti-Conservative,-0.296
4," When we consider the heroic resistance made by the French Army against heavy odds in this battle, the enormous losses inflicted upon the enemy and the evident exhaustion of the enemy, it may well be the thought that these 25 divisions of the best-trained and best-equipped troops might have turned the scale",Anti-LibDem,-0.0258
5," However, General Weygand had to fight without them",Non-Aligned,-0.3818
6, Only three British divisions or their equivalent were able to stand in the line with their French comrades,Conservative,0.0

11, We cannot afford it,Non-Aligned,0.0
12," I recite them in order to explain why it was we did not have, as we could have had, between twelve and fourteen British divisions fighting in the line in this great battle instead of only three",LibDem,0.3612
13, Now I put all this aside,Non-Aligned,0.0
14," I put it on the shelf, from which the historians, when they have time, will select their documents to tell their stories",Non-Aligned,0.0

16, This also applies in a small way to our own affairs at home,Non-Aligned,0.0

26, It has received the almost unanimous support of both Houses of Parliament,Labour,0.5888
27," Its Members are going to stand together, and, subject to the authority of the House of Commons, we are going to govern the country and fight the war",Anti-Labour,-0.7579
28," It is absolutely necessary at a time like this that every Minister who tries each day to do his duty shall be respected; and their subordinates must know that their chiefs are not threatened men, men who are here today and gone tomorrow, but that their directions must be punctually and faithfully obeyed",DUP,0.7003

30, I should not think it would be very advantageous for the House to prolong this Debate this afternoon under conditions of public stress,Anti-SNP,-0.4215
31, Many facts are not clear that will be clear in a short time,LibDem,0.6369
32," We are to have a secret Session on Thursday, and I should think that would be a better opportunity for the many earnest expressions of opinion which Members will desire to make and for the House to discuss vital matters without having everything read the next morning by our dangerous foes",Labour,0.296
33,The disastrous military events which have happened during the past fortnight have not come to me with any sense of surprise,SNP,0.0
34," Indeed, I indicated a fortnight ago as clearly as I could to the House that the worst possibilities were open; and I made it perfectly clear then that whatever happened in France would make no difference to the resolve of Britain and the British Empire to fight on, ‘if necessary for years, if necessary alone",Anti-LibDem,-0.6249
35,"” During the last few days we have successfully brought off the great majority of the troops we had on the line of communication in France; and seven-eighths of the troops we have sent to France since the beginning of the war-that is to say, about 350,000 out of 400,000 men-are safely back in this country",Conservative,0.8934
36," Others are still fighting with the French, and fighting with considerable success in their local encounters against the enemy",Anti-LibDem,-0.128
37," We have also brought back a great mass of stores, rifles and munitions of all kinds which had been accumulated in France during the last nine months",SNP,0.8176
38,"We have, therefore, in this Island today a very large and powerful military force",UKIP,0.0
39," This force comprises all our best-trained and our finest troops, including scores of thousands of those who have already measured their quality against the Germans and found themselves at no disadvantage",Conservative,0.0
40, We have under arms at the present time in this Island over a million and a quarter men,SNP,0.0
41," Behind these we have the Local Defense Volunteers, numbering half a million, only a portion of whom, however, are yet armed with rifles or other firearms",Conservative,0.0772
42, We have incorporated into our Defense Forces every man for whom we have a weapon,Non-Aligned,-0.296
43," We expect very large additions to our weapons in the near future, and in preparation for this we intend forthwith to call up, drill and train further large numbers",Anti-Green,-0.2263
44," Those who are not called up, or else are employed during the vast business of munitions production in all its branches-and their ramifications are innumerable-will serve their country best by remaining at their ordinary work until they receive their summons",Conservative,0.6369
45, We have also over here Dominions armies,Non-Aligned,0.0
46," The Canadians had actually landed in France, but have now been safely withdrawn, much disappointed, but in perfect order, with all their artillery and equipment",Conservative,0.5994
47, And these very high-class forces from the Dominions will now take part in the defense of the Mother Country,Non-Aligned,0.0
48,"Lest the account which I have given of these large forces should raise the question: Why did they not take part in the great battle in France? I must make it clear that, apart from the divisions training and organizing at home, only 12 divisions were equipped to fight upon a scale which justified their being sent abroad",LibDem,0.6249
49, And this was fully up to the number which the French had been led to expect would be available in France at the ninth month of the war,Anti-Labour,-0.5574
50," The rest of our forces at home have a fighting value for home defense which will, of course, steadily increase every week that passes",Anti-Labour,-0.3818
51," Thus, the invasion of Great Britain would at this time require the transportation across the sea of hostile armies on a very large scale, and after they had been so transported they would have to be continually maintained with all the masses of munitions and supplies which are required for continuous battle-as continuous battle it will surely be",Labour,0.7506
52,"Here is where we come to the Navy-and after all, we have a Navy",Non-Aligned,0.0
53, Some people seem to forget that we have a Navy,Anti-UKIP,-0.2263
54, We must remind them,LibDem,0.0
55," For the last thirty years I have been concerned in discussions about the possibilities of oversea invasion, and I took the responsibility on behalf of the Admiralty, at the beginning of the last war, of allowing all regular troops to be sent out of the country",Anti-Conservative,-0.4588
56," That was a very serious step to take, because our Territorials had only just been called up and were quite untrained",LibDem,0.0
57," Therefore, this Island was for several months particularly denuded of fighting troops",Anti-LibDem,-0.3818
58," The Admiralty had confidence at that time in their ability to prevent a mass invasion even though at that time the Germans had a magnificent battle fleet in the proportion of 10 to 16, even though they were capable of fighting a general engagement every day and any day, whereas now they have only a couple of heavy ships worth speaking of-the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau",UKIP,0.4019
59, We are also told that the Italian Navy is to come out and gain sea superiority in these waters,Non-Aligned,0.7845
60," If they seriously intend it, I shall only say that we shall be delighted to offer Signor Mussolini a free and safeguarded passage through the Strait of Gibraltar in order that he may play the part to which he aspires",LibDem,0.8979
61, There is a general curiosity in the British Fleet to find out whether the Italians are up to the level they were at in the last war or whether they have fallen off at all,Anti-Conservative,-0.7506
62,"Therefore, it seems to me that as far as sea-borne invasion on a great scale is concerned, we are far more capable of meeting it today than we were at many periods in the last war and during the early months of this war, before our other troops were trained, and while the B",Anti-SNP,-0.5719

65, had proceeded abroad,SNP,0.0
66," Now, the Navy have never pretended to be able to prevent raids by bodies of 5,000 or 10,000 men flung suddenly across and thrown ashore at several points on the coast some dark night or foggy morning",Non-Aligned,0.0572
67," The efficacy of sea power, especially under modern conditions, depends upon the invading force being of large size; It has to be of large size, in view of our military strength, to be of any use",Non-Aligned,0.6808
68," If it is of large size, then the Navy have something they can find and meet and, as it were, bite on",UKIP,0.0
69," Now, we must remember that even five divisions, however lightly equipped, would require 200 to 250 ships, and with modern air reconnaissance and photography it would not be easy to collect such an armada, marshal it, and conduct it across the sea without any powerful naval forces to escort it; and there would be very great possibilities, to put it mildly, that this armada would be intercepted long before it reached the coast, and all the men drowned in the sea or, at the worst blown to pieces with their equipment while they were trying to land",Non-Aligned,-0.5574
70," We also have a great system of minefields, recently strongly reinforced, through which we alone know the channels",LibDem,0.6249
71," If the enemy tries to sweep passages through these minefields, it will be the task of the Navy to destroy the mine-sweepers and any other forces employed to protect them",Anti-UKIP,-0.2263
72," There should be no difficulty in this, owing to our great superiority at sea",Non-Aligned,0.8225
73,"Those are the regular, well-tested, well-proved arguments on which we have relied during many years in peace and war",Anti-Green,-0.7506
74, But the question is whether there are any new methods by which those solid assurances can be circumvented,Non-Aligned,0.1531
75," Odd as it may seem, some attention has been given to this by the Admiralty, whose prime duty and responsibility is to destroy any large sea-borne expedition before it reaches, or at the moment when it reaches, these shores",Anti-Green,-0.4939
76, It would not be a good thing for me to go into details of this,Conservative,0.4404
77," It might suggest ideas to other people which they have not thought of, and they would not be likely to give us any of their ideas in exchange",LibDem,0.3612
78," All I will say is that untiring vigilance and mind-searching must be devoted to the subject, because the enemy is crafty and cunning and full of novel treacheries and stratagems",UKIP,0.3182
79," The House may be assured that the utmost ingenuity is being displayed and imagination is being evoked from large numbers of competent officers, well-trained in tactics and thoroughly up to date, to measure and counterwork novel possibilities",SNP,0.3818
80," Untiring vigilance and untiring searching of the mind is being, and must be, devoted to the subject, because, remember, the enemy is crafty and there is no dirty trick he will not do",Anti-LibDem,-0.0516
81,"Some people will ask why, then, was it that the British Navy was not able to prevent the movement of a large army from Germany into Norway across the Skagerrak? But the conditions in the Channel and in the North Sea are in no way like those which prevail in the Skagerrak",LibDem,0.3818
82," In the Skagerrak, because of the distance, we could give no air support to our surface ships, and consequently, lying as we did close to the enemy’s main air power, we were compelled to use only our submarines",LibDem,0.4019
83, We could not enforce the decisive blockade or interruption which is possible from surface vessels,Anti-Labour,-0.34
84," Our submarines took a heavy toll but could not, by themselves, prevent the invasion of Norway",SNP,0.0258
85," In the Channel and in the North Sea, on the other hand, our superior naval surface forces, aided by our submarines, will operate with close and effective air assistance",Non-Aligned,0.7717
86,"This brings me, naturally, to the great question of invasion from the air, and of the impending struggle between the British and German Air Forces",Green,0.6249
87, It seems quite clear that no invasion on a scale beyond the capacity of our land forces to crush speedily is likely to take place from the air until our Air Force has been definitely overpowered,Green,0.7096
88," In the meantime, there may be raids by parachute troops and attempted descents of airborne soldiers",Conservative,0.0
89," We should be able to give those gentry a warm reception both in the air and on the ground, if they reach it in any condition to continue the dispute",Labour,0.25
90," But the great question is: Can we break Hitler’s air weapon? Now, of course, it is a very great pity that we have not got an Air Force at least equal to that of the most powerful enemy within striking distance of these shores",SNP,0.7579
91," But we have a very powerful Air Force which has proved itself far superior in quality, both in men and in many types of machine, to what we have met so far in the numerous and fierce air battles which have been fought with the Germans",LibDem,0.5574
92," In France, where we were at a considerable disadvantage and lost many machines on the ground when they were standing round the aerodromes, we were accustomed to inflict in the air losses of as much as two and two-and-a-half to one",Anti-Labour,-0.5574
93," In the fighting over Dunkirk, which was a sort of no-man’s-land, we undoubtedly beat the German Air Force, and gained the mastery of the local air, inflicting here a loss of three or four to one day after day",Anti-LibDem,-0.128
94," Anyone who looks at the photographs which were published a week or so ago of the re-embarkation, showing the masses of troops assembled on the beach and forming an ideal target for hours at a time, must realize that this re-embarkation would not have been possible unless the enemy had resigned all hope of recovering air superiority at that time and at that place",UKIP,0.8126
95,In the defense of this Island the advantages to the defenders will be much greater than they were in the fighting around Dunkirk,Non-Aligned,-0.0258
96," We hope to improve on the rate of three or four to one which was realized at Dunkirk; and in addition all our injured machines and their crews which get down safely-and, surprisingly, a very great many injured machines and men do get down safely in modern air fighting-all of these will fall, in an attack upon these Islands, on friendly",Conservative,0.7783
97, soil and live to fight another day; whereas all the injured enemy machines and their complements will be total losses as far as the war is concerned,Anti-UKIP,-0.8316
98,"During the great battle in France, we gave very powerful and continuous aid to",Conservative,0.6249
99," the French Army, both by fighters and bombers; but in spite of every kind of pressure we never would allow the entire metropolitan fighter strength of the Air Force to be consumed",Conservative,0.5767
100," This decision was painful, but it was also right, because the fortunes of the battle in France could not have been decisively affected even if we had thrown in our entire fighter force",Anti-Green,-0.4019
101," That battle was lost by the unfortunate strategical opening, by the extraordinary and unforseen power of the armored columns, and by the great preponderance of the German Army in numbers",Conservative,0.4767
102," Our fighter Air Force might easily have been exhausted as a mere accident in that great struggle, and then we should have found ourselves at the present time in a very serious plight",Green,0.5423
103," But as it is, I am happy to inform the House that our fighter strength is stronger at the present time relatively to the Germans, who have suffered terrible losses, than it has ever been; and consequently we believe ourselves possessed of the capacity to continue the war in the air under better conditions than we have ever experienced before",Conservative,0.25
104," I look forward confidently to the exploits of our fighter pilots-these splendid men, this brilliant youth-who will have the glory of saving their native land, their island home, and all they love, from the most deadly of all attacks",Green,0.9201
105,"There remains, of course, the danger of bombing attacks, which will certainly be made very soon upon us by the bomber forces of the enemy",Anti-UKIP,-0.8658
106," It is true that the German bomber force is superior in numbers to ours; but we have a very large bomber force also, which we shall use to strike at military targets in Germany without intermission",UKIP,0.7269
107," I do not at all underrate the severity of the ordeal which lies before us; but I believe our countrymen will show themselves capable of standing up to it, like the brave men of Barcelona, and will be able to stand up to it, and carry on in spite of it, at least as well as any other people in the world",UKIP,0.1744
108," Much will depend upon this; every man and every woman will have the chance to show the finest qualities of their race, and render the highest service to their cause",Non-Aligned,0.0
109," For all of us, at this time, whatever our sphere, our station, our occupation or our duties, it will be a help to remember the famous lines: He nothing common did or mean, Upon that memorable scene",Conservative,0.4019
110,"I have thought it right upon this occasion to give the House and the country some indication of the solid, practical grounds upon which we base our inflexible resolve to continue the war",Anti-DUP,-0.5106
111," There are a good many people who say, “Never mind",LibDem,0.4404
112," Win or lose, sink or swim, better die than submit to tyranny-and such a tyranny",Non-Aligned,0.0258
113,” And I do not dissociate myself from them,Non-Aligned,0.0
114," But I can assure them that our professional advisers of the three Services unitedly advise that we should carry on the war, and that there are good and reasonable hopes of final victory",LibDem,0.2263
115," We have fully informed and consulted all the self-governing Dominions, these great communities far beyond the oceans who have been built up on our laws and on our civilization, and who are absolutely free to choose their course, but are absolutely devoted to the ancient Motherland, and who feel themselves inspired by the same emotions which lead me to stake our all upon duty and honor",SNP,0.891

118," Menzies of Australia, Mr",UKIP,0.0
119," Fraser of New Zealand, and General Smuts of South Africa-that wonderful man, with his immense profound mind, and his eye watching from a distance the whole panorama of European affairs-I have received from all these eminent men, who all have Governments behind them elected on wide franchises, who are all there because they represent the will of their people, messages couched in the most moving terms in which they endorse our decision to fight on, and declare themselves ready to share our fortunes and to persevere to the end",Anti-LibDem,-0.1027
120, That is what we are going to do,Non-Aligned,0.0
121,"We may now ask ourselves: In what way has our position worsened since the beginning of the war? It has worsened by the fact that the Germans have conquered a large part of the coast line of Western Europe, and many small countries have been overrun by them",Anti-Conservative,-0.7717
122, This aggravates the possibilities of air attack and adds to our naval preoccupations,Anti-Conservative,-0.4767
123," It in no way diminishes, but on the contrary definitely increases, the power of our long-distance blockade",Green,0.0
124," Similarly, the entrance of Italy into the war increases the power of our long-distance blockade",Non-Aligned,-0.5994
125, We have stopped the worst leak by that,Anti-UKIP,-0.8271
126," We do not know whether military resistance will come to an end in France or not, but should it do so, then of course the Germans will be able to concentrate their forces, both military and industrial, upon us",UKIP,0.0
127, But for the reasons I have given to the House these will not be found so easy to apply,LibDem,0.0
128," If invasion has become more imminent, as no doubt it has, we, being relieved from the task of maintaining a large army in France, have far larger and more efficient forces to meet it",UKIP,0.3182
129,"If Hitler can bring under his despotic control the industries of the countries he has conquered, this will add greatly to his already vast armament output",UKIP,0.34
130," On the other hand, this will not happen immediately, and we are now assured of immense, continuous and increasing support in supplies and munitions of all kinds from the United States; and especially of aeroplanes and pilots from the Dominions and across the oceans coming from regions which are beyond the reach of enemy bombers",LibDem,0.8555
131,"I do not see how any of these factors can operate to our detriment on balance before the winter comes; and the winter will impose a strain upon the Nazi regime, with almost all Europe writhing and starving under its cruel heel, which, for all their ruthlessness, will run them very hard",Anti-SNP,-0.6597
132," We must not forget that from the moment when we declared war on the 3rd September it was always possible for Germany to turn all her Air Force upon this country, together with any other devices of invasion she might conceive, and that France could have done little or nothing to prevent her doing so",Anti-Green,-0.6908
133," We have, therefore, lived under this danger, in principle and in a slightly modified form, during all these m6nths",Anti-LibDem,-0.5267
134," In the meanwhile, however, we have enormously improved our methods of defense, and we have learned what we had no right to assume at the beginning, namely, that the individual aircraft and the individual British pilot have a sure and definite superiority",LibDem,0.7003

140," During that war we repeatedly asked ourselves the question: How are we going to win? and no one was able ever to answer it with much precision, until at the end, quite suddenly, quite unexpectedly, our terrible foe collapsed before us, and we were so glutted with victory that in our folly we threw it away",Anti-Green,-0.4588

39, Eden in the House of Commons,Labour,0.0
40, I should like to express my sincere thanks for the opportunity of making a reply offered me by the frank and notable statement of the British Foreign Minister,LibDem,0.6124
41,"I shall first try to correct what seems to me a most regrettable error - namely, that Germany never had any intention of isolating herself, of passing by the events of the rest of the world without sharing them, or that she does not want to pay any consideration to general necessities",Anti-UKIP,-0.6381

49,The German Government has assured Belgium and Holland of its readiness to recognize and guarantee these States as untouchable and neutral regions for all time,Non-Aligned,0.34
50,From the economic point of view there is not the least reason to assert that Germany is giving up international cooperation,Labour,0.0
51,"When I consider the speeches of many statesmen in the last few months, the impression may be obtained that the whole world is waiting to inundate Germany with economic favors, which we refuse to share",Labour,0.7783
52, The German people have been making commercial treaties to bring about a more lively exchange of goods,Conservative,0.4404
53, German foreign trade has increased since 1932 both in volume and in value,Conservative,0.34
54,I do not believe that there can be durable economic cooperation except on the basis of a new mutual exchange of goods,Conservative,0.4404
55, World economics are not suffering from any refusal of Germany to participate in them,Anti-Green,-0.5423
56, When we got into power the world economic crisis was worse than today,Labour,0.0
57,I fear that I must interpret Mr,Anti-UKIP,-0.4939
58, Eden's words as meaning that he sees in the carrying out of the Four-Year Plan a refusal of international relations on the part of Germany,Labour,0.0

62,"If Europe does not awaken to the danger of bolshevist infection, commerce will decrease in spite of all the good will of individual statesmen",Anti-UKIP,-0.5994
63, Therefore I am not in a position to judge the economic future of Europe as optimistically as Mr,Conservative,0.5267
64, Eden apparently does,Non-Aligned,0.0
65," I rejoice at every increase of our foreign trade, but in view of the political situation I shall not regret anything that will guarantee to the German people their existence when other nations have perhaps become the victims of bolshevist infection",Anti-Conservative,-0.5994
66," The British Foreign Minister offers us theoretical prospects of existence, whereas in reality totally different things are happening - for instance, the revolutionizing of Spain has driven 15,000 Germans from the country and done great harm to our commerce",Green,0.6369
67, Should this revolutionizing of Spain spread to other European countries the damage would be increased,Green,0.0

69," A number of great nations do not belong to it or have left it, without anybody being able to assert that these countries were in favor of a policy of isolation",Labour,0.7964

73,"The division into two parts, not only of Europe but of the rest of the world, is an accomplished fact",Non-Aligned,0.4215
74," It is to be regretted that the British Government did not decide earlier that a division of Europe must be avoided under all circumstances, for then we would not have had a Treaty of Versailles",Anti-Conservative,-0.6124
75,"Secondly, division has been brought about by the proclamation of the bolshevist doctrine, the chief feature of which is to enforce itself on all peoples",Non-Aligned,0.34
76, For Mr,UKIP,0.0
77," Eden, bolshevism is perhaps a thing which has its seat in Moscow, but for us it is a pestilence against which we have had to struggle at the cost of much bloodshed - a pestilence which tried to make of our country the same desert as Spain",Labour,0.34
78," National Socialism has not sought to conquer bolshevism in Russia, but Jewish International Moscow Bolshevists have tried to invade Germany and are still trying to",UKIP,0.34
79, It is not suitable that National Socialist Germans should ever hope to protect bolshevism or that we should ever accept help from a bolshevist State,UKIP,0.8689
80,Three times I have made concrete offers for armament restriction or at least limitation,Anti-LibDem,-0.3818
81, These offers were rejected,Non-Aligned,-0.4019

83, Mr,UKIP,0.0
84, Eden believes that in future all States should have only that armament which is necessary for their defense,Non-Aligned,0.0
85, I do not know whether Mr,UKIP,0.0
86, Eden has already got into touch with Moscow about the realization of this fine idea or what assurances he has got there,Non-Aligned,0.6808

89, We cannot imagine anyone outside London being competent to estimate the strength necessary for the protection of the British Empire,LibDem,0.7003

91, A general recognition of these principles would contribute to a lessening of the tension,Anti-Labour,-0.3182
92, Germany is happy to have found Italy and Japan to be of the same opinion,Non-Aligned,0.0
93, Nobody welcomed the apparent lessening of the tension in the Mediterranean brought about by the Anglo-Italian agreement more than we,LibDem,0.2263

97," Our sympathies with General Franco and his Government are in the first place of a general nature, but they are also based on the hope that the consolidation of a real National Spain may lead to a strengthening of the European economic system",Labour,0.6369
98, We are ready to do everything which may lead to a restoration of orderly conditionsin Spain,Non-Aligned,0.0
99,"During the last 100 years a number of new nations have arisen in Europe which, owing to their incapacity, have been of no economic importance and almost of no political significance",SNP,0.0772
100, They have brought into the world new tensions,Non-Aligned,-0.3182
101," The new Italian State, however, is a reality",Non-Aligned,0.0
102, The German people and the German Reich are also a reality,Green,0.0
103, The Polish people and State are also a reality,Non-Aligned,0.0
104,The unreasonable division of the world into peoples who have and peoples who have not does not remove or solve problems,Anti-Green,-0.4019
105," If it is to be the task of the League of Nations only to guarantee the existing state of the world and to safeguard it for all time, then we might as well entrust it also with the task of guarding the high tide and the low tide, or of regulating for the future the direction of the Gulf Stream",Green,0.3818
106, Its continued existence depends on the extent to which it is realized that necessary reforms which concern the relations of the nations must be considered and put into practice,Non-Aligned,0.0
107,"The German people once built up a Colonial Empire, without robbing anyone and without any war",UKIP,0.7244
108, This was taken away from us,Labour,0.0
109," It was said that the natives did not want to belong to Germany, that the colonies were not adminis- tered properly by the Germans, and that these colonies had no true value",Green,0.4767
110," If this is true, this valuelessness would also apply to the other nations, and there is no reason why they should wish to keep them from us",Labour,0.6705
111," Germany has never demanded colonies for military purposes, but exclusively for economic ones",UKIP,0.4157
112," It is obvious that in times of general prosperity the value of certain territories may shrink, but it is just as clear that in time of distress such value changes",Labour,0.0772
113, Today Germany lives in a time of fierce struggle for foodstuffs and raw materials,Non-Aligned,0.0
114, Sufficient imports are only conceivable if there is a continued increase in our exports,Conservative,0.0
115, Therefore the demand for colonies for our densely populated country will again and again be raised as a matter of course,Anti-UKIP,-0.1027
116,"I should like to express a few opinions on possible ways of bringing about a genuine pacification of Europe, and beyond:-1",LibDem,0.3612

127,6,Non-Aligned,0.0
128," It is impossible to maintain peace so long as an international, irresponsible clique continues its agitation un-checked",LibDem,0.0
129, I greatly regret that the British Foreign Minister did not state categorically that there was not one word of truth in the calumnies about Morocco spread by these international war agitators,Anti-UKIP,-0.6597
130," Thanks to the loyalty of a foreign diplomat and his Government, the immediate clearing up of this stirring case was made possible, but is it not conceivable that on another occasion it might not be possible to enable the truth to come to light so quickly, and what would happen then?7",Green,0.7506
131, It has been proved that European problems can be solved properly only within the limits of the possible,Anti-Green,-0.0772
132, Germany is hoping to have close and friendly relations with Italy,Conservative,0.4404

134, The German Reich will watch over its security and honor with its strong Army,Non-Aligned,0.7579

137," It would be profitable to European peace as a whole if, in the treatment of the nationalities who are forced to live as minorities within other nations, mutual consideration were shown for national honor and consciousness",Green,0.7269
138, This would lead to a decisive lessening of tension between the nations who are forced to live side by side and whose State frontiers are not identical with the frontiers of the people,Anti-Conservative,-0.3182
139,In concluding these remarks I should like to deal with the document which the British Government addressed to the German Government on the occasion of the occupation of the Rhineland,Labour,0.3612
140," We are convinced that the British Government at that time did everything to lessen the tension, and that the document in question was intended to contribute to disentangling the situation",Anti-LibDem,-0.3182
141," Nevertheless it was not possible for the German Government, for reasons which the British Government will certainly appreciate, to reply to those questions",LibDem,0.0
142,We preferred to settle some of those questions in the most natural way by the practical improvement of our relations with our neighbors,Non-Aligned,0.0
143," I should like to state now that completeGerman sovereignty and equality have been restored, and that Germany will never sign a treaty which is in any way incompatible with the honor of the nation and of the Government which represents it, or which otherwise is incompatible with Germany's vital interests and therefore in the long run cannot be kept",UKIP,0.872

# Honours

This repository contains all the coded work for my project for Honours at Robert Gordons University.

The concept of the honours was to prove that through the analysis of public social media data attained from Twitter, lexical trends can be determined.

These trends could then be applied to a machine learning model to then determine political allignment of said user.

Further work also showed that the social media data could be used to train the model to recognise political undertones in speeches.

Main Components:

Web Scrapper (Developed by Honours Supervisor John Issacs), which has been adjusted by myself.
Node.JS Web Service that makes use of Fusion Charts package to visualise data.
Python Flask RESTful API which handles the fetching and analysing of social media data
R Statistical work, although not utalized in the final project R was used as the first attempt at social media training but was abandoned due to its clunkyness compared to Python


Main Python Packages: Tweepy, Pandas, JSon, NLTK, Pickle, SKLearn, Flask
